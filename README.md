# Pollution-Tracker

It is a program that tells the API(Air Pollution Index) and further pollutants level in air of any city in the world.

## Introduction
So this is the Python program that uses Python as a programming language. I have to use the API of [AQCIN](https://aqicn.org/city/all/) website to fetch information about the pollution level of the city. So I have used an API key to get access to website data. Here we first fetch the data in the form of a Dictionary and the according to the key we display the output of that field. If the field is not available we show a message with "Not available". And after that using Matplotlib, we plot the pie chart of various pollutants in the air.

## Installation
```bash
https://github.com/sagarmude7/Pollution-Tracker.git
cd Pollution-Tracker
```

## Packages

I have used three packages 
* Tkinter : For the GUI of window
```bash
pip install Tkinter
```
* Matplotlib : To plot the pie chart which shows the percentage of different pollution levels in the air of the city.
```bash
pip install matplotlib
```
* Request : To fetch the information from the website.
```bash
pip install requests
```



## Output
* Main Window which ask the name of the city to user
